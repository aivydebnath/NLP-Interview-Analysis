General Data Science Questions (For all candidates) Interviewer: Can you explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?  Candidate: Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the target outcome is known. The model learns to predict the output based on the input data. Common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, deals with unlabeled data. The model tries to identify patterns or groupings within the data without prior knowledge of the outcomes. Examples of unsupervised learning algorithms are k-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA).  Interviewer: How do you handle missing data in a dataset?  Candidate: There are several strategies to handle missing data, including:  Removal: If the proportion of missing data is small, removing the affected rows or columns might be appropriate. Imputation: Replacing missing values with mean, median, or mode values; or using more sophisticated methods like KNN imputation or predictive modeling.
